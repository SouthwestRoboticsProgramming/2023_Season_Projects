##### OpenCV Installation
Update PIP using `pip install --upgrade pip`. If it isn't installed, use the command `sudo apt install python3-pip`, then update.

Check your python version using `python3 --version`. You should be using **python 3.8.** The easiest way to change the version that you are using is by clicking the current version in the bottom right of VSCode (Note: This will only update the settings for VSCode, not the whole system).

Install OpenCV using the command `pip3 install opencv-contrib-python`. Use the contrib version instead of `opencv-python` for full functionality. To check that is is installed, just use python3 and then try `import cv2`. If this does not work, check that all of the dependencies are present using `pip3 check opencv-contrib-python`.
