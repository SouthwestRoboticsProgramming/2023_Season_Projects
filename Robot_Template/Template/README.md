# Robot_Libraries
Libraries to make writing robot code easier in the future.

### Motor
Creates a new way of controlling a motor that will automatically decide what mode to use to achieve the desired result.

### Math
Creates replacments for WPILib's Translation2d and Rotation2d that define the direction of the angle, and give more tools for vectors. This ensures that when the user gets an angle, it is alreay normalized to the state that they need, preventing mistakes such as mechanisms being 90 degrees off.

### Swerve
A helper libary for swerve drive to simplify the whole process. Fully custom kinematics for fine tuning of our drive base and greater control.
